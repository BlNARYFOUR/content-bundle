For now, this bundle has a proof-of-concept document for static content, and
the controller to render it.

TODO: build a generic content bundle. 

Ideas:
- Annotations on document to know which fields to render
- Annotations on document to swap the twig template to render the content
- Make navigation use this controller by default if no mapping found?
